// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain




//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "The secon step, where the busness needs are planned out and the needs of the user are defined. "
const design = "design the system to be used and created."
const implementation ="implement the software design for use and integrate it's components."
const testingIntegration = "looking for bugs, fixing bugs, making sure the sytem is working correctly."
const maintain = "fixing issues that may arise later down the implementation pipline, maintain system stability."
